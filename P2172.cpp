/*
You are given an integer array nums of length n and an integer numSlots such that 2 * numSlots >= n. 
There are numSlots slots numbered from 1 to numSlots.

You have to place all n integers into the slots such that each slot contains at most two numbers. 
The AND sum of a given placement is the sum of the bitwise AND of every number with its respective slot number.

For example, the AND sum of placing the numbers [1, 3] into slot 1 and [4, 6] into slot 2 is equal to 
(1 AND 1) + (3 AND 1) + (4 AND 2) + (6 AND 2) = 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 4.
Return the maximum possible AND sum of nums given numSlots slots.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6], numSlots = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: One possible placement is [1, 4] into slot 1, [2, 6] into slot 2, and [3, 5] into slot 3. 
This gives the maximum AND sum of (1 AND 1) + (4 AND 1) + (2 AND 2) + (6 AND 2) + (3 AND 3) + (5 AND 3) = 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 9.
